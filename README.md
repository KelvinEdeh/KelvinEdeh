### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# KELVIN EDEH
### Data Analyst and Sales Specialist

Welcome to another world of data. With a great interest in entrepreneurship, I channel my  data skills to helping my organization and other organizations make concrete, data-driven sales and product development decisions. I am analytical-minded and problem-centered with a dynamic approach to conceptualization, cleaning, visualization, storytelling, and decision-making. I am well-grounded in SQL, spreadsheets (Excel and Google Sheets), PowerBI, and Python. My greatest career strategy is continuous learning and a growth mindset. I hold data analyst certification from DataCamp and ALX Africa

My data skills have been boosted by my vast experience in sales and product development. Over one year, I  have had the privilege of working with two early-stage tech startups at the stage of finding product-market fit and scaling customer base.
