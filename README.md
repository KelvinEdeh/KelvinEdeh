### Hi there 👋

# KELVIN EDEH
### Data Analyst and Sales Specialist

Welcome to another world of data. With a great interest in entrepreneurship, I channel my  data skills to helping my organization and other organizations make concrete decisions in sales and product development. It is beyond visualization and queries but problem-solving and meaningful stories. I am well-grounded in SQL, spreadsheets (Excel and Google Sheets), PowerBI, and Python. My greatest career strategy is continuous learning and growth mindset. I hold data analyst certification from DataCamp and ALX Africa

My data skills have been boosted by my vast experience in sales and product development. Over one year, I  have had the privilege of working with early-stage startups as a sales associate and business developer.
